Notes:
  This procedure will randomly select a street name from the table
  variable loaded herein. 

  While it would be preferable to have implemented this as a function,
  the NEWID mechanism needed to make this work are not allowed within
  a function hence the requirement to implement in a stored procedure.

Usage:
  DECLARE @r AS NVARCHAR(20)
  EXEC [DataLoadSimulation].[GetRandomStreet] @randomStreet = @r OUTPUT;
  SELECT @r
