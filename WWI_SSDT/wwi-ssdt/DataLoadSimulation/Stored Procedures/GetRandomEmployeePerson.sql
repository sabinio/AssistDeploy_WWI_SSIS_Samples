CREATE PROCEDURE [DataLoadSimulation].[GetRandomEmployeePerson]

Notes:
  Selects a random person ID.

  As with other similar procs, we have to use a proc as opposed
  to a function as random tools such as NEWID and RAND don't work
  in functions

Usage:
  DECLARE @myEmployeePersonID INT
  EXEC [DataLoadSimulation].[GetRandomEmployeePerson]
      @EmployeePersonId = @myEmployeePersonID OUTPUT
  SELECT @myEmployeePersonID 

*/
  
  SELECT TOP(1) 
         @EmployeePersonID = PersonID
    FROM [Application].People
   WHERE IsEmployee <> 0
     AND ValidTo = '99991231 23:59:59.9999999'
   ORDER BY NEWID()
  
  RETURN
