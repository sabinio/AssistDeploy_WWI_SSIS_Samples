Notes:
  Selects stock item to adjust ID.

  As with other similar procs, we have to use a proc as opposed
  to a function as random tools such as NEWID and RAND don't work
  in functions

Usage:
  DECLARE @myStockItemIDToAdjust INT
  EXEC [DataLoadSimulation].[GetRandomStockItemToAdjust]
    10, @StockItemIDToAdjust = @myStockItemIDToAdjust OUTPUT
  SELECT @myStockItemIDToAdjust

   ORDER BY NEWID()
  
  RETURN
