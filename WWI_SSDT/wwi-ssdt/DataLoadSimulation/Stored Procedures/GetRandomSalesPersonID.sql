Notes:
  Selects a random sales person ID.

  As with other similar procs, we have to use a proc as opposed
  to a function as random tools such as NEWID and RAND don't work
  in functions

Usage:
  DECLARE @SalesPersonID INT
  EXEC [DataLoadSimulation].[GetRandomSalesPersonID]
    @RandomSalesPersonID = @SalesPersonID OUTPUT
  SELECT @SalesPersonID

     AND ValidTo = '99991231 23:59:59.9999999'
   ORDER BY NEWID()
  
  RETURN
