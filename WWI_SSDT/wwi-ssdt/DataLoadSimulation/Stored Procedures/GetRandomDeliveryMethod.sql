Notes:
  Selects a random delivery method.

  As with other similar procs, we have to use a proc as opposed
  to a function as random tools such as NEWID and RAND don't work
  in functions

Usage:
  DECLARE @DeliveryMethod INT
  EXEC [DataLoadSimulation].[GetRandomDeliveryMethod]
    @RandomDeliveryMethod = @DeliveryMethod OUTPUT
  SELECT @DeliveryMethod

   ORDER BY NEWID()
  
  RETURN
